        <p>
            Obesity is caused by eating an imbalanced diet which is not only high
            in calories but lacks essential nutrients. Many times, ignorance or
            emotional eating and stressful life leads to overeating, thus resulting
            into overweight.
        </p>

        <p>
            If obesity is not controlled well on time, it can lead to many health
            problems like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, gallbladder
            disease, fatty liver and cancer as well.
        </p>
